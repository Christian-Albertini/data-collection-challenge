# data-collection-challenge
UNC Module 11 Challenge
I referenced the various activities from the week to help with this assignment.  I used stack overflow for help remembering how to save to a csv file.  I also had to look up how to use astype for datetime on stack overflow.
I forgot how to rotate the tick marks on the x-axis of plots so I had to look that up.
